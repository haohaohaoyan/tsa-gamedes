# TSA Game Design
TSA Game Design project. 
Current ideas:
- A metroidvania/platformer with a few enemies
- Futuristic setting
- Gameplay mechanics: double jumps, walljumps, dash, attacks

Development logs:
- 1/11/2026 (Haoyan): added basic platformer movement, a basic scene tree, a bit of demo terrain. Currently reuses some old tilesets I used to have.
- 1/18/2026 (Haoyan): added some more mechanics: double jumping, wall jumps, coyote jumps, and made the demonstration level larger
